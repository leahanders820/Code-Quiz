# Code-Quiz


This application is supposed to be a timed coding quiz that shows one question on the page at a time and moves to the next one after the answer choice is submitted. The timer goes down at a normal pace but if a question is answered wrong, a certain amount of seconds are subtracted. Nothing is functional and code is unfinished and there's an error showing up for some reason as well as console logs not showing up for whatever reason.
